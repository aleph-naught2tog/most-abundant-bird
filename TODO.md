# TODO ðŸš§

- [ ] fix canvas size/width
- [ ] resize - we're caching the feathers, so that part is done.
  - [ ] (does this need some other parameter for dealing with a new canvas size? I think so.)
- [ ] accessibility descriptions

## IDEAS

* some sort of hover effect?
  * hover over a feather (hard...?)
  * hover over a chunk? (easier?)
    * this relies on chunks being there
* make generic for a given set of data
  * problem: colors won't work
  * problem: CDN
    * if we skip the CDN, we could probably do a little preload magic
      * this requires a server file
* sliders etc for the various parameters
* make this usable for other things dynamically -- upload a file, see the max birds, upload your bird photos + pixel points
